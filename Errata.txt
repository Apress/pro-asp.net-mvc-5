1. First page after cover, last paragraph: "Any source code or other supplementary material referenced by the author in this text is available to readers at
www.apress.com/9781430257882": The url should be http://www.apress.com/9781430265290. The ISBN from the url from the book is wrong, pointing to other book "Entity Framework 6 Recipes" by Brian Driscoll.

2. Page 4: Two missing enclosing brackets (typos):
	- Section "Agile and Test-Driven Development" (begun on page 3), last paragraph, first phrase: "independent software vendor (ISV" should be "independent software vendor (ISV)".
	- Section "Ruby on Rails", last paragraph, second phrase: "object-relational mapping (ORM" should be "object-relational mapping (ORM)".

3. Page 35: Section "Using Model Binding", 1st paragraph (typo): "Figure 2-18" should be "Figure 2-19".

4. Page 58: Section "Breaking and Declaring Dependencies", last phrase (typo): "In short, the PassworsResetHelper..." should be "In short, the PasswordResetHelper...".

5. Page 59: Section "Using a Dependency Injection Container", Tip, second phrase (grammatical): "I are going to use Ninject..." should be "I am going to use Ninject...".

6. Page 95: Chapter 5 - "Working with Razor", first phrase (typo): "A view engine procezses ASP.NET content..." should be "A view engine processes ASP.NET content...".

7. Page 107: Table 5-2, first row, second column (typo): "Passa view model object..." should be "Pass a view model object...".

8. Page 232: Section "Removing Items from Cart", second line (grammatical): "... which I are going to do..." should be "... which I am going to do...".

9. Page 234: Section "Adding the Cart Summary", first paragraph, last line (words doubled): "adding a new a new item to the cart" should be "adding a new item to the cart".

10. Page 246: Section "Implementing the Interface", in the "foreach (var line = cart.Lines)" block there is a missing closing bracket in the format string (it doesn't affect the functionality, it's just about look): "{0} x {1} (subtotal: {2:c}" should be "{0} x {1} (subtotal: {2:c})".

11. Page 264: Section "Helping the Controller Select a View", Listing 10-4: "@Html.ActionLink("Home", "List", "Product", new { @class = "btn btn-default btn-sm" })" should be "@Html.ActionLink("Home", "List", "Product", null, new { @class = "btn btn-default btn-sm" })" (After "Product" should be a null, as the routeValues parameter, and then "new { @class = ...", which is the htmlAttributes parameter. As it is now in the book, "Product" is (wrongly) interpreted as routeValues. The error is present also in the example code.)

12. Page 267: Section "Removing View Duplication", Listing 10-7: same error as #11.

13. Page 374: Section "Introducing URL Patterns", Table 15-2 (typos): Segment Variables column values for the first three rows should have a separator (space, comma) between the controller name and the "action" segment variable name:
	- controller = Admin, action = Index 
	- controller = Index, action = Admin 
	- controller = Apples, action = Oranges

14. Page 382: Section "Defining Default Values", Table 15-3 (typos): same as #13.

15. Page 392: Section "Defining Optional URl Segments", Table 15-4 (typos): same as #13.

16. Page 395: Section "Defining Variable-Length Routes", Table 15-5 (typos): same as #13.

17. Page 425: Section "Generating Fully URLs in Links", Listing 16-9: " myFragmentName" is specified in code (note the leading space), but later it's mentioned in the generated URL "MyId#myFragmentName", with no space between "#" and "myFragmentName".

18. Pages 430 - 433: Section Customizing the Routing System: The final example is not working (at least when I tried it, with VisualStudio 2015, .Net Framework 4.5.2, ASP.NET MVC 5), because the URLs containing dots (.) cannot be routed by default using legacy routing. I found two solutions for this, both by adding some XML in the Web.config file, under configuration / system.webServer (create if doesn't exist):
	1. 	<modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" />
	2. 	<handlers>
			<add name="HtmlFileHandler" path="*.html" verb="GET" type="System.Web.Handlers.TransferRequestHandler" preCondition="integratedMode,runtimeVersionv4.0" />
		</handlers>
None of this "solutions" are recommended due to performance issues and because sometime we don't want to route all the "*.html" URLs, by example (but for demonstration is ok). In our example we can use the second technique, by narrowing the routed paths like path="articles/*.html", if we have in the original structure a folder containing HTML files with articles.

19. Page 455: Section "Creating a Controller by Deriving from the Controller Class", the paragraph before Listing 17-3, last lines (typo): "... with some simple changesto set a ViewBag property..." should be "... with some simple changes to set a ViewBag property...".

20. Page 488: Section "Introducing Filter Types", within the tip (typo): "IoverrideFilter" should be "IOverrideFilter".

21. Page 509: Section "Using Action Filters", within the second phrase of the first paragraph (typo): "The built-in class for creating..." should be "The built-in interface for creating...".

22. Page 512: Section "Implementing the OnActionExecuted Method", Listing 18-36 (typo): "This is the ActionFilterTest action" should be "This is the FilterTest action" (It's not consistent with the previous method version and with the Figure 18-8, representing the running result, at page 513).

23. Page 513: Section "Using Result Filters", Listing 18-37 (typo): In the description, "ProFileResultAttribute.cs" should be "ProfileResultAttribute".

24. Page 525: Section "Overriding Filters", the last paragraph: The property FiltersToOverride from the IOverrideFilter interface is referred as method, twice: "The FilterToOverride method returns..." and "... I implemented the FiltersToOverride method...".

25. Page 563: Section "Creating a Custom IView", in the Write method of the DebugDataView class: "writer.Write(string.Format(template, values) + "<p/>");" should be "writer.Write("<p>" + string.Format(template, values) + "<p/>");" (the starting "<p>" tag is missing).

26. Page 591: Section "Creating an Inline Helper Method", within the tip (typo): "Notice that I prefixed the foreach keyword with @ in this example but not in Listing 21-4." should be "Notice that I prefixed the foreach keyword with @ in this example but not in Listing 21-3." (Listing number is incorrect.)

27. Page 598: Section "Encoding Helper Method Content", within the first change to the DisplayMessage helper method: the bold style should by applied to the "string" word (which is the new method type) instead of "static".

28. Page 605: Section "Creating Form Elements", Listing 21-19: The statement "Using the Most Complex Overload of the BeginForm in the CreatePerson.cs File" should be "Using the Most Complex Overload of the BeginForm in the CreatePerson.cshtml File".

29. Page 631: Section "Using Metadata to Control Editing and Visibility", in the end of the paragraph before Listing 22-12: "... set the value of the DisplayValue property in the DisplayName attribute to false..." should be "... set the value of the DisplayValue property in the HiddenInput attribute to false...".

30. Page 631: Section "Using Metadata to Control Editing and Visibility", Listing 22-12: The statement "Using the HiddenInput Attribute to Hide a Property in the Person.cshtml File" should be "Using the HiddenInput Attribute to Hide a Property in the Person.cs File".

31. Page 633: Section "Using Metadata for Labels", within the paragraph before Listing 22-13: "... I can apply the DisplayName attribute..." should be "... I can apply the Display attribute..." (The DisplayName attribute is explained after Listing 21-13).

32. Page 664: Section "Working with Ajax Callbacks", Table 23-4: The property and jQuery events from the second and fourth rows are not matching the descriptions from the respective row and should be switched. So <OnSuccess, success> should be described as "Called if the request is successful", irrespective <OnComplete, complete> as "Called when the request has been completed, irrespective of whether the request succeeded or failed".

33. Page 666: Section "Working with Ajax Callbacks", within the paragraph before Figure 23-8 (typo): "... clicking one of the links will display a sequence of alters..." should be "... clicking one of the links will display a sequence of alerts...".

34. Page 714: Section "Explicitly Validating a model", within the paragraph before the explanation of ModelState.IsValid: "This method returns true if I called the Model.State.AddModelError method during the checks..." should be "This property returns false if I called the ModelState.AddModelError method during the checks...".

35. Page 722: Section "Performing Validation in the Model Binder", within Table 25-3 (typo): The method name "OmModelUpdated" should be "OnModelUpdated".

36. Page 743: Section "Creating the Layout and View", at the end of the last paragraph in the page: "I added a view file called MakeBooking.cshtml to the Home/Views folder..." should be "I added a view file called MakeBooking.cshtml to the Views/Home folder...".

37. Page 750: Section "Defining the Bundles", Listing 26-6 contains an artifact within this line: "BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);,bv"; it should be only "BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);".

38. Page 767: Section "Understanding API Controller Action Selection": There are three places where the request URLs are wrong:
	1. "/api/reservation" should be "/api/web" (paragraph #2).
	2. "/api/reservation API" should be "/api/web URL"; here is a second fault: "API" should be "URL" (papargraph #3).
	3. "/api/reservation/3" should be "/api/web/3" (paragraph #3).
